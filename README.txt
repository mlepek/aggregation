This repository contains C++ code for simulating aggregation processes with arbitrary kernels,
and for calculating theoretical predictions using exact combinatorial approach and Bell polynomials.

The separate Readme files are inside the folders of "theory" and of "simulations".
"Theory" and "simulations" are two separate projects.

How to cite?
If you use the code or ideas from this repository in your research, please refer to the main paper:

"A review on combinatorial approach to aggregation"
by M. Lepek, A. Fronczak & P. Fronczak, submitted to Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena.

Best regards!

This repository contains C++ code for simulating aggregation processes with arbitrary kernels,
and for calculating theoretical predictions using exact combinatorial approach and Bell polynomials.

The separate Readme files are inside the folders of "theory" and of "simulations".
"Theory" and "simulations" are two separate projects.
